An online banking system in Java is a sophisticated application designed to provide customers with convenient and secure access to their financial accounts over the internet. This system allows users to perform various banking operations such as viewing account balances, transferring funds, paying bills, and managing personal information.

Security
Security is paramount in an online banking system. Java provides strong security features, including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for encrypted communication and Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) for user authentication and authorization. Additionally, sensitive data such as passwords and personal information are encrypted using algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

Features
Key features of the system include account balance inquiries, transaction history, fund transfers between accounts, bill payments, loan applications, and customer support. The system also provides notifications and alerts to keep users informed about their account activities.

Conclusion
An online banking system in Java combines robust backend functionalities, comprehensive security measures, and extensive features to deliver a reliable and convenient banking experience. By leveraging Javaâ€™s powerful features and libraries, developers can create scalable and maintainable applications that meet the demanding needs of the banking sector.
